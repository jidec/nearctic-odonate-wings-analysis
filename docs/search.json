    "text": "Intro\nInsects have adapted the color of their bodies for many ecological functions including sexual selection, mimicry, and thermoregulation. In Odonata, the cosmopolitan insect clade containing dragonflies and damselflies, wing color has been shown to play a role in thermoregulation and territorial signaling between males. Yet previous measurements in large-scale analysis of Odonate wing color draw an incomplete picture by neither capturing the spatial patterning of colors on the wing nor differentiating between different kinds of pigment-driven colors despite the presence of colors other than pure black. It remains an open question what kinds of wing colors and patterns have evolved across Odonata and how they might play roles in signaling and thermoregulation that differ predictably depending on life history strategy. The ODOMATIC wing dataset containing 8000 wings imaged by flatbed scanner provides a means to resolve this."
